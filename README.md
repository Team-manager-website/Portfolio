## Intro
Welcome to my portfolio of semester 3. In my portfolio you can find all my work of semester 3. I also tell you what the learning outcomes of this semester are and how I achieved them. 

I have worked on a group project and an individual project. For the group project I worked together with Matthijs Dolmans, Casper van den Dijk, Rik Fieret Arthur Brouwers. For my individual project I worked alone on a project that I was allowed to come up with myself.

## Learning Outcomes
Here are the learning outcomes I've achieved, along with the proof of my work.
Learning Outcome | Explanation | Rating | Proof 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Web application | I try to make my application as user friendly as possible, I have watched other websites how they managed their ux. <br><br>I have made my application full stack by making a front-end in Vue. I made a back-end service in java where I work with apiâ€™s where i use a external service. I also work with the service from Auth0 for my authentication and login service. | Proficient | [Front-end](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Team-Manager-Front-end)<br> [Back-end](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Team-Manager-Back-End)<br>
Software quality | In my project I have worked with Unit tests and Integration tests. I did this to test new figures that I add to my project. When I create a pull request sonarcload will review my code. My api is secured with Oauth so i can safely make connection with my api. I also let my fellow students watch the code if they think the quility of the code is good. | Proficient | [Back-end](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Team-Manager-Back-End)<br> [Research document OAuth2](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Portfolio/blob/main/Documents/Research/Authorization%20api%20with%20OAuth%202.0.md)
Agile method | For my individual and group project we use the scrum method. I used in this semester sprint reviews, retrospectives and only for the group project standups and standdowns. In the group project we make use of Jira and for my individual project I use Github. Jira is more detailed than Github. After every sprint we have made a retrospective on the last sprint this is be done on the group project and on the individual project. | Proficient | [Group project retrospective](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Sprint/AllSprints.md)<br> [Individual  project retrospective](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Portfolio/blob/main/Documents/Retrospective.md) 
CI/CD | When I create a pull request I automatically test and build my front/back-end. If all of that succeeded than I merge my code and it will create a docker container where i can run my application in anathor environment. | Proficient | [Front-end](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Team-Manager-Front-end)<br> [Back-end](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Team-Manager-Back-End)<br> [Research document Ci/Cd and Docker](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Portfolio/blob/main/Documents/Research/Ci-Cd%20and%20Docker.md)
Cultural differences and ethics | In my group-project I have noticed that there are different cultural values in my group and for our product owner. We have made a code of etics about some etics in our own project. | Proficient | [Code of ethics](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Ethics.md) 
Requirements and design | In our group project, we made every sprint new requirements. We decided which requirements to use based on the stakeholder's feedback. We have created a low/high-resolution design for our stakeholder. | Proficient | [Design document](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Design.md) 
Business processes | We have prepared various types of documents for our stakeholders and project, such as ERD and a c4 model. | Proficient | [Erd](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/ERD.md)<br> [C4 model](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/C4%20model.md)
Professional | With everything I did with the stakeholder I was professional and seriously and took his advice. We also did this with the group project if we were in contact with the stakeholder. And when we worked together, we were professional, and we used effective communication, so everyone knows what to do. After every sprint I made a retrospective on what went well and what went bad last sprint. I also made 2 research documents. | Proficient | [Research document OAuth2](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Portfolio/blob/main/Documents/Research/Authorization%20api%20with%20OAuth%202.0.md)<br> [Research document Ci/Cd and Docker](https://github.com/Team-manager-website/Portfolio/blob/main/Documents/Research/Ci-Cd%20and%20Docker.md)
