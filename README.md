Learning Outcome | Explanation | Rating | Proof 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Web application | I try to make my application as user friendly as possible, I have watched other websites how they managed their ux. <br><br>I have made my application full stack by making a front-end in Vue. I made a back-end service in java where I work with api’s where i use a external service .... I also work with the service from Auth0 for my authentication. | d | d 
Software quality | In my project I have worked with Unit tests and Integration tests. I did this to test new figures that I add to my project. todo: code analytic. I also let my fellow students watch the code if they thing the quility of the code is good. | b | d | d 
Agile method | For my individual and group project we use the scrum method. I used in this semester sprint reviews, retrospectives, backlogs and only for the group project standups and standdowns. In the group project we make use of Jira and for my individual project I use Github. Jira is more detailed than Github. | b | d | d 
CI/CD | I automatically test and build my front/back-end. | b | d | d
Cultural differences and ethics | In my group-project I have noticed that there are different cultural values in my group and for our product owner. By understanding it and it helped me by understanding it and so the process was smoother because of it. I have ACM into my project so it can help to make ethical decisions. | b | d | d 
Requirements and design | In my logic folder I have tested some functions with unit tests. I have done this with the package … In the group project we have turned requirements from the project owner into user stories. Before the user story was finished the project owner first have a look at it and if it was good the user story was finished. In my individual project I only made user stories and had no requirements to work with. | b | d | d 
Business processes | I have made some designs for my individual project and before I implement it, I ask feedback from my stakeholder. We also did this for our group project, only we did this more often and we took more into account what their idea of the application was. | b | d | d 
Professional | With everything I did with the stakeholder I was professional and seriously if it was going about the project. We also did this with the group project if we were in contact with the stakeholder. And when we worked together, we were professional, and we used effective communication, so everyone knows what to do. And we also helped each other if someone needed some help, this was certainly for the group project but also for the individual project. | b | d | d
