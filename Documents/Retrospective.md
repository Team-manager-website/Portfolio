# Retrospective

## Sprint 1&2
In the first two sprint I did not make I retrospective but I released that something can be do better. So, for myself I start a retrospective in sprint three.

## Sprint 3
Down here I have made my first retrospective. I found a retrospective
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Coding | Sticking to the same issue | Planing 
 | |  | Documentation
  |  |  | Moitvation
 
 For myself the coding aspect of the project went well but because of that I did not work on any documentation. It was not always that I worked to much on the coding part of the project but the motivation for the documentation could be better. That is also a thing that could be better the motivation aspect. The motivation on the first week of the sprint was good but it could not make it through the second week. What could be a problem is that I stick to a problem that I want to solve which I better put aside for a while.
