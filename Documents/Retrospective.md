# Retrospective

## Sprint 1&2
In the first two sprint I did not make I retrospective but I released that something can be do better. So, for myself I start a retrospective in sprint three.

## Sprint 3
Down here I have made my first retrospective. I found a retrospective
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Coding | Sticking to the same issue | Planing 
 | |  | Documentation
  |  |  | Moitvation
 
 For myself the coding aspect of the project went well but because of that I did not work on any documentation. It was not always that I worked to much on the coding part of the project but the motivation for the documentation could be better. That is also a thing that could be better the motivation aspect. The motivation on the first week of the sprint was good but it could not make it through the second week. What could be a problem is that I stick to a problem that I want to solve which I better put aside for a while.

## Sprint 4
Down here I have made my second retrospective for sprint 4. 
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Coding | Sticking to the same issue | Planing 
Documentation |  | Moitvation

For this sprint, the coding and documentation went well. In the beginning I was a little bit struggling with the jpa for storing data in the database but after a little time that went well. And there was a little bit of a problem with my files in the back-end but I managed to correct the problem fast so I didn't lose very much time with it. And for the documentation part went well, I spent an afternoon working on it and made everything I wanted to achieve. Sticking to the same issue was still a problem this sprint hopefully it will not happen next sprint. For the planning could be better, I am going to make smaller assignments for myself so hopefully that help the problem and the motivation problem. The motivation was better, but I have a bit of trouble starting up in the beginning.

## Sprint 5
Down here I have made my retrospective for sprint 5.
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Documentation | Sticking to the same issue | Moitvation
 | | Coding | 

For this sprint, the documentation went well. I had good progression with it. For what caused problems I have again sticking on the same issue because I had a lot of issues this sprint and after some time, I just wanted to finish it, but I couldn’t fix it. I have also coded there because of the issues that I couldn’t fix. Secondly, I also I have motivation, it has improved but to I the problem is to start the day but when I started, I worked longer then normally.

## Sprint 6
Down here I have made my retrospective for sprint 6.
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Documentation | Sticking to the same issue | 

I do not have a lot of things in my retrospective this sprint. This sprint I did not do much on coding and what I did went well, but I do not feel like it is something that went very well. My motivation was better this sprint, but I do not feel that it went that good to go to the wat went well. I had some progression in my documentation so that went well. The thing that caused a problem was that I sticked to long at my api security problem because I wanted it to work.

## Sprint 7
Down here I have made my retrospective for sprint 7.
What went well | What caused problems | What can be better  
--- | --- | ---
Productivity | Time manegment | 

This sprint went well. I have finished everything I wanted to finish. But I think if I managed my time better, I could have made more progress. However, I have finished every target because my productivity was good. I didn't have many problems, but if I did, I put them aside and started with something else.
